Welcome to my blackjack app!

This app was built using HTML and JavaScript. I built it by creating HTML elements in JavaScript to test my knowledge of working with data at that level. 

When the page loads you should see an empty board that has deal and hit button below it.

The player and dealer scores should be 0 when you load the page. Each time you hit deal you and the dealer should receive your cards.
Here is where the fun part starts. My understanding of blackjack is very limited, so the program does not actually follow the rules. The way it works here is that each card represents a different numerical value stored in the array, and when they are dealt the user and dealr recieve image and point values from that deck array. 

Whovever reaches the max score first wins, and when you clear the end of game alert the game resets. 

Essentially it is a luck based game with minimal strategy. Have fun and good luck!
